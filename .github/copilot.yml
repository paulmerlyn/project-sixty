# High-level guidance for Copilot the AI assistant
instructions:
  - Pay attention to any guidance I've added to docs/guidance.md
  - Principal idea: I'd like to use vibe coding to build a simple web site for ecommerce. I want you to use Next.js. 
  - The site will need to integrate with Stripe as its payment gateway for handling payments in local currencies – especially US dollars, Indian rupees, and British pounds. 
  - The volume of transactions will be moderate (this isn't going to be a large-scale venture like eBay!). I want to deploy to Vercel as my cloud provider. 
  - Keeping costs low is important because I'm self-funding. I have good full-stack skills but I’m not experienced in Next.js, so add plenty of documentation in the code and in README files to help me. 
  - Initially, just set up the structure of the project and just a basic “hello world” page. I will later add details of the content and desired site map. Pay attention to good site organization so we can add other pages as needed.  
  - Adhere to consumer privacy regulations and best practices regarding cookies if the site needs to use cookies.
  - At this point, don’t include any sort of database because I don’t think the site will need to persist any data. The customer details (e.g. email address) and payment transactions will be persisted by Stripe. 
  - The main product to be sold on the site is a simple web-based game called “Just a Minute”.
  - After making a purchase via Stripe, the user will be able to access a download button to download the “Just a Minute” game as a single HTML file.
